# Abstract
EasySniff is a smooth, clean, and effective network sniffing tool. It abstracts unnecessary technical information and makes monitoring traffic a lot easier for users. It provides a clean GUI with customizable tools and settings that the user can put to use. This tool was made to be used as an alternative to some other sniffers that may seem haphazardly made. Furthermore, it is to be used for educational purposes in the sector of network-oriented programming.

# Features
Some functions and features within EasySniff are as follows:
  - Compact executable--roughly 250KB!
  - Highly organized interface--I have OCD.
  - Multi-threaded design--100% smooth operation.
  - Full sniffing GUI oriented around the IPv4 and UDP protocols--support for more will likely come in the future--maybe.
  - Immediate geolocation of any captured IP address--non-local.
  - Immediate ISP-related information returned for captured IPs.
  - Service integrity information regarding an ISP--known security technology.
  - Easy data export methods--IP and packet data.
  - Ability to ping any captured address on the fly!
  - Ability to quickly scan a chosen IP for any open ports.
  - Ability to look up more narrowed, specific information regarding an address.
  - Options to show more advanced data regarding captured packets.
  - ...and more!

# Control Schemes
EasySniff has a few control schemes--shortcuts--for some functions that it performs. These control schemes can be found below:
  - Key click [C]:
    - ...to clear the captured addresses (or packet data).
  - Key click [S]:
    - ...to begin or end the sniffing process.
  - Single click [any mouse key]:
    - ...to copy any selected data in any shown cell.
  - Single click [any mouse key] + P:
    - ...to perform a port scan on an IP from an appropriate cell.
  - Double click [any mouse key]:
    - ...to ping a selected IP from an appropriate cell.
